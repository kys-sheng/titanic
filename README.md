Problem: Predict who survive in the titanic tragedy based on their data such as Age, Gender, etc.


My attempt on the titanic problem from Kaggle. Please refer to the following website for more details.

This work have minimal/occaasional reference from:
https://www.kaggle.com/code/startupsci/titanic-data-science-solutions

Few things to be improved:
1. Use prediction to fill NaN values instead of filling with 0 or -1
2. Group Age in to bins (kids,teen, adult, senior)
